h2. What

A Framework for building Cocoa applications in Ruby

Rucola is a light weight framework that helps you write RubyCocoa apps.
It allows you to build, test, and deploy applications using rake commands, 
eliminating the need to use XCode, however you can use XCode if you wish.

Rucola provides a set of generators to help you generate controllers, window controllers, 
and document-based applications.  It also provides APIs for simplifying some of Objective-C's 
ways of doing things.

h2. Requirements

* "RubyCocoa 0.13":http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=44114&package_id=36578 That's NOT the one included with Leopard, which is 0.12
* For testing it's adviced to install the following gems: test-spec, mocha, zentest (autotest)

h2. Installing

<pre syntax="sh">sudo gem install rucola</pre>

h2. Demonstration of usage

h3. Generating an application skeleton

    rucola MyApp -a "Your Name"

Running this command will give you a complete, working application with a single window already 
bound to your application controller.


h3. Using Notifications

    h4. Rucola
    <pre syntax="ruby">
    class Foo < Rucola::RCController
      notify :some_method, :when => :something_happens
  
      def some_method(notification)
        puts "w00t!"
      end
    end
    </pre>

    h4. Objective C (Excluding header file)
    <pre syntax="c">
    @implementation Foo
    -(id)init {
      if(self = [super init]) {
        NSNotificationCenter *center = [NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter];
        [center addObserver:self selector:(some_method:) name:@"SomethingHappensNotification" object:nil];
      }
      return self;
    }
    
    -(void)some_method:(NSNotification *) notification {
      NSLog("w00t!");
    }
    @end
    </pre>

h3. Alternative Way Of Using Notifications

    <pre syntax="ruby">
    class Foo < Rucola::RCController
      notify_on :something_happens do |notification|
        puts "w0t0!"
      end
    end
    </pre>

h3. Working with Interface Builder

A Cocoa application contains `outlets`.  Outlets allow you to bind variable names to objects.
An object can be a user interface element or an instance of a class.

    <pre syntax="ruby">
    class ApplicationController < Rucola::RCController
      ib_outlet :main_window

      def awakeFromNib
        # All the application delegate methods will be called on this object.
        OSX::NSApp.delegate = self

        puts "ApplicationController awoke."
        puts "Edit: app/controllers/application_controller.rb"
        puts  "\nIt's window is: #{@main_window.inspect}"
      end

      # NSApplication delegate methods
      def applicationDidFinishLaunching(notification)
        puts "\nApplication finished launching."
      end

      def applicationWillTerminate(notification)
        puts "\nApplication will terminate."
      end
    end
    </pre>

The `@main_window` variable now points to the user interface window.  You can invoke any methods of NSWindow.

There is also a `rake ib:update` that will update your nib files with the outlets you specify in your code.
For example, if we wanted to add a button to the application controller above, we could add `ib_outlet :my_button`.
After you've added this, you can run `rake ib:update` and your outlet will be available in interface builder that 
you can now hook up to your UI button.

h2. Extras

Sample apps can be found at:

<pre syntax="sh"> svn co svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rucola/extras/examples/</pre>

There's a basic TextMate bundle which contains only 4 commands which are the equivalent of the "go to file" commands in the rails bundle. With these going from a controller to it's test/model/view file is only a shortcut away. To get it:

<pre syntax="sh">
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/
svn co svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rucola/extras/Rucola.tmbundle
</pre>

There's a crash reporter plugin and a ActiveRecord plugin available. Check their descriptions with:

<pre syntax="sh">
cd MyApp
script/plugin list
</pre>

Or install them with:

<pre syntax="sh">
cd MyApp
script/plugin install SACrashReporter
</pre>
