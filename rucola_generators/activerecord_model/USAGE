Description:

The model generator creates stubs for a new model.

The generator takes a model name as its argument. The model name may be given
in CamelCase or under_score and should not be suffixed with 'Model'.

This is not as advanced as the rails one (at least yet) so you can't do fancy
tricks with attributes.

Usage:

ruby script/generate activerecord_model FooBar

This will create:
  app/models/foo_bar.rb
  app/models/foo_bar_proxy.rb
	db/migrate/create_foo_bars.rb
