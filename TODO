* rake ib:update doesn't yet update from model files. The question is, should we allow that,
  or should people handle interaction with the view in the controller anyways...?

* See if #when is a better method name than #notify_on. So:

  when :app_did_finish_launching do |notification|
    puts 'w00t!'
  end

* Did some restructuring of the dir layout with regards to controllers and initialize_hooks (rev 42).
  Should probably look if the require structure is still ok... Justin knows about this.

* Create tests for initializer.rb.

* Create templates for testing in either TestUnit, TestSpec or rSpec.
  I don't use rSpec anymore atm, so I (Eloy) will first focus on TestUnit & TestSpec.
  Actually I will just move it to test/spec.

* Create README & simple website and release first version!

* No need to continuously rebuild your application when just changing a few lines of Ruby.
  Still does xcodebuild for the build task, so add a check if the xcode project was updated,
  if not then simply run the existing build.

* Allow transparent packaging.  Developers need only worry about creating their application 
  and basic configuration not the innards of packaging and releasing. 

  config.objc_frameworks << ['Webkit', 'Quartz']
  config.active_record = true
  config.include_dirs << %w(models controllers lib)

* When in debug mode and using ActiveRecord, allow database to reside in your working 
  directory for easy access instead of buried in your users Application Support path.

* Load database config from config/database.yml
