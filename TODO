* We need to give the user the option to add anonymous controllers to nibs
  and optionally instantiate them. If no nibs are specified MainMenu.nib should be the default.
  So without extra options:
  $ script/generate controller Foo
    create app/controllers/foo_controller
    ...
  Would you like me to add the class Foo to MainMenu.nib? [y/n]
  Would you like me to instantiate class Foo in MainMenu.nib? [y/n]

  With extra options:
  $ script/generate controller Foo MainMenu Another Preferences
    create app/controllers/foo_controller
    ...
  Would you like me to instantiate class Foo in MainMenu.nib? [y/n]
  Would you like me to instantiate class Foo in Another.nib? [y/n]
  Would you like me to instantiate class Foo in Preferences.nib? [y/n]

* Remove the acts_as_foo class method and registering stuff.
  Because we will simply include these modules by default.

* [DONE] Rake task rc:freeze:current should also look in /System and ~/Library

* [DONE] Rake task :build expects the build dir to be in the source root,
  but this is not always true. So look in xcode prefs.

* script/generate window_controller capitalizes when specifying a camel case name.

* [DONE] Allow Apps running in debug mode to use code from your working directory.

* [DONE] Create tests for xcode.rb.

* Create tests for initializer.rb.

* [DONE] Create tests for rucola_support/window_controller.rb.

* Make autotest work with the directory structure.

* [DONE] Create freeze current task, which will freeze the rubycocoa framework installed in /Library/Frameworks.

* [DONE] Create install plugin task.

* [DONE] Add hooks into initializer that load the plugins.

* Create a simple controller generator that will only create a controller
  file & class which inherits from OSX::NSObject.

* Create templates for testing in either TestUnit, TestSpec or rSpec.
  I don't use rSpec anymore atm, so I (Eloy) will first focus on TestUnit & TestSpec.

* Create README & simple website and release first version!

* [DONE] Create a task that uses rb_nibtool.rb to check controllers and their nibs for changes
  and update them.

* No need to continuously rebuild your application when just changing a few lines of Ruby.
  Still does xcodebuild for the build task, so add a check if the xcode project was updated,
  if not then simply run the existing build.

* Allow transparent packaging.  Developers need only worry about creating their application 
  and basic configuration not the innards of packaging and releasing. 

  config.objc_frameworks << ['Webkit', 'Quartz']
  config.active_record = true
  config.include_dirs << %w(models controllers lib)

* When in debug mode and using ActiveRecord, allow database to reside in your working 
  directory for easy access instead of buried in your users Application Support path.

* Load database config from config/database.yml
