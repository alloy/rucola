* Rake task rc:freeze:current should also look in /System and ~/Library

* Rake task :build expects the build dir to be in the source root,
  but this is not always true. So look in xcode project.

* [DONE] Allow Apps running in debug mode to use code from your working directory.

* [DONE] Create tests for xcode.rb.

* Create tests for initializer.rb.

* [DONE] Create tests for rucola_support/window_controller.rb.

* Make autotest work with the directory structure.

* Create freeze current task, which will freeze the rubycocoa framework installed in /Library/Frameworks.

* Create install plugin task.

* [DONE] Add hooks into initializer that load the plugins.

* Create a simple controller generator that will only create a controller
  file & class which inherits from OSX::NSObject.

* Create templates for testing in either TestUnit, TestSpec or rSpec.
  I don't use rSpec anymore atm, so I (Eloy) will first focus on TestUnit & TestSpec.

* Create README & simple website and release first version!

* Create a task that uses rb_nibtool.rb to check controllers and their nibs for changes
  and update them.

* No need to continuously rebuild your application when just changing a few lines of Ruby.
  Still does xcodebuild for the build task, so add a check if the xcode project was updated,
  if not then simply run the existing build.

* Allow transparent packaging.  Developers need only worry about creating their application 
  and basic configuration not the innards of packaging and releasing. 

  config.objc_frameworks << ['Webkit', 'Quartz']
  config.active_record = true
  config.include_dirs << %w(models controllers lib)

* When in debug mode and using ActiveRecord, allow database to reside in your working 
  directory for easy access instead of buried in your users Application Support path.

* Load database config from config/database.yml
