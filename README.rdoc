= Rucola::Vinegar

Focus:

* A lean GUI toolkit
* Usable as a vinegar layer in a pure MacRuby/Objective-C app
* Keep magic to a minimum
* Make the most used Cocoa classes more accessible to new Cocoa developers (rubyists)
* Make sensible assumptions as defaults
* Only provide shortcuts for common performed operations
* Actual Cocoa object should always be accessible for more elaborate operations
* Should follow the HIG as Interface Builder does it
* Should we flip the views? I think most first time Cocoa users will expect that

Ideas:

* Vinegar objects are proxies for an actual Cocoa instance
* Do inheriting in the same way as in Cocoa to ease transition
  * View as a base class for all NSView classes
    * TODO: should a view yield itself on initialization?
  * Control as a base class for all NSControl classes
    * Calls the block given to ::new as the action
  * etc
